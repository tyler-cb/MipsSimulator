An executable JAR file can be found in the root directory, named MipsSimulator-1.0-all.jar. This has been developed and runs using Java 17.

After launching the program, the default MIPS configuration should be loaded from Jsons/MIPS_Model.json

The project can be built into a jar file with Gradle 7.4+, by running the command gradle :shadowJar. The jar file can then be found in build/libs
